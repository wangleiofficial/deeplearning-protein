* **Generative models for graph-based protein design**<br>
**Abstract**:  Engineered proteins offer the potential to solve many problems in biomedicine,
energy, and materials science, but creating designs that succeed is difficult in
practice. A significant aspect of this challenge is the complex coupling between
protein sequence and 3D structure, with the task of finding a viable design often
referred to as the inverse protein folding problem. In this work, we introduce a
conditional generative model for protein sequences given 3D structures based on
graph representations. Our approach efficiently captures the complex dependencies
in proteins by focusing on those that are long-range in sequence but local in 3D
space. This graph-based approach improves in both speed and reliability over
conventional and other neural network-based approaches, and takes a step toward
rapid and targeted biomolecular design with the aid of deep generative models.<br>
